# Hand-Keyboard Tracker

\[WIP\] a program for tracking which hand and finger was used when typing a certain key.

## Dependencies

-   opencv
-   mediapipe
-   pynput
-   protobuf

## How to run

To run the program, simply, run `python3 main.py` to your terminal with **admin** access. This should be opened in a dedicated terminal and not in embedded ones like the terminal in VSCode as the keyboard listener may malfunction.
